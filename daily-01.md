## How websites are created
- What you see when you are looking at a website is most like your browser receiving the HTML and CSS from the host server
  * Most website include extra content such as images and videos

## Structure 
- Some elements used to structure a web page are:
```
<html> </html>
<body> </body>
<h1> </h1>
<p> </p>
```
  * In between the opening `<html>` tag and closing `</html> tag indicates to the page that this is HTML code
  * The `<body>` tag indicates that it should be shown inside the main browser window `</body>`
  * The `<h1> </h1>` indicates that it will be a main heading
  * The `<p> </p>` tag is for a paragraph
-There are thing called attirbutes that tell us more about the elements, such as:
```
<p lang="en-us'>
```
>lang is the attribute and the value of that is "en-us"

## Extra Markup
- DOCTYPES tell the browser which version of HTML you are using
  * HTML5 `<!DOCTYPE html>` 
  * HTML 4
 ```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.W3.org/TR/html4/:oose.dtd">
```
- Comments in code can be added by `<!-- the comment goes here -->` 

- ID Attributes and Class attributes
  * Every HTML element can carry the id attribute
  * Example `<p id="pullquote">`
    * `<p class="important">`

- Meta
  * The `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` and contains infomation about the web page
  * The meta element is empty so it does not need a closing tag
  * The meta is not visable to the user of the web page

  * Header `<header>` and footer `<footer>`  
  * The main header or footer that appears at the top and bottom of every page
