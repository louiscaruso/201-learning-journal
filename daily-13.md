# Local Storage

## What we really want?
- A lot of storage space
- On the client
- That persists beyond a page refresh
- And isn't transmitted to the server

## Intro HTML5 storage
- "HTML5 Storage" is web Storage
- What is it? A way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. 
- This data stays even after you stay

## Using HTML5 Storage
- Based on named key/value pairs
- Store with the name key then you can retrieve it later with the same key name
